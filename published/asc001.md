Add 'volume' parameter to gel_separate instruction

#### **Motivation**
The amount of liquid to be added to each well of a gel is an important experimental parameter, as it can affect the distribution of current throughout the gel and thus the quality of the resultant gel image.

#### **Proposal**
The `gel_separate` instruction should take an additional mandatory parameter, `"volume"`, of type `volume`. This specifies the volume of liquid to be pipetted into each well of the gel. The same volume will be used for all specified wells in the `gel_separate` instruction, so that results are properly comparable.

Example:

```
{
  "op": "gel_separate",
  "volume": "15:microliter",
  "objects": [
    "plate1/A1",
    "plate1/A2"
  ],
  "matrix": "agarose(8,0.8%)",
  "ladder": "ladder1",
  "duration": "5:minute",
  "dataref": "gel"
}
```

#### **Compatibility**
To aid transition to the addition of the mandatory `"volume"` parameter, implementations should continue to accept `gel_separate` instructions with no volume specified. If no volume is specified, the volume shall be assumed to be 20 microliters.
