#### **Title**

Flash Freeze


#### **Authorship**

Cornelia Scheitz <conny@transcriptic.com>


#### **Motivation**

Flash freezing is done using liquid nitrogen and as such needs special equipment and dedicated sample handling to withstand the ultra-low temperatures. As such it deserves a dedicated Autoprotocol instruction.


#### **Proposal**

```
{
 "op": "flash_freeze",
 "object": container,
 "duration": "30:second" //between 10:second and 180:second
}

```


#### **Execution**

The container specified will be dipped into liquid nitrogen for the set period of time. The container can then be used in other autoprotocol instructions or be stored.


#### **Compatibility**

This ASC only specifies new instructions.
