#### **Title**
Add `type` parameter to seal instruction

#### **Motivation**
The type of seal can be different depending on the application. For example qPCR applications require ultra-clear seals to read the fluorescence data from the wells. Regular PCR can use either foil or clear seals. Sealing a plate with DMSO will require a chemically resistant seal which likely foil based.

#### **Proposal**
The `seal` instruction should take an additional mandatory parameter, `"type"`, of type `string`. This specifies the type of seal to be applied to the plate.

Example:

```
{
  "op": "seal",
  "object": container,
  "type": "foil"
}
```
The types available are specified by the vendor, examples are: "ultra-clear", "foil".

#### **Compatibility**
To aid transition to the addition of the mandatory `"type"` parameter, implementations should continue to accept `seal` instructions with no type specified. If no type is specified, the type shall be assumed to be an ultra-clear seal.
