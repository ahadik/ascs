#### **Motivation**
Acoustic liquid handling is `droplet_size` based with most instruments only capable of transferring a single `droplet_size`. The final `volume` to be transferred must be an integer multiple of this `droplet_size`. An additional instruction specifying that liquid is to be transferred via an acoustic liquid handler vs. a tip-based air-displacement pipettor is therefore necessary since these instructions require and permit different parameters.

#### **Proposal**
```
{
  "op": "acoustic_transfer",
  "groups": [
    {
      "transfer": [
        {
          "from": well,
          "to": well,
        "volume": volume
  }
        ...
       ]
    }
  ],
  "droplet_size": volume
}
```

Vendor defaults may apply to “droplet_size”.

#### **Compatibility**
This ASC only proposes the addition of a new instruction.
