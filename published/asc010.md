#### **Motivation**
The `autopick` instruction as it currently stands does not allow for relating returned data, such as the number of colonies counted, to an instruction.  It also does not specify other options for colony picking such as only picking colonies of a specific size or color.

#### **Proposal**
We propose adding two new fields to the `autopick` instruction:
`dataref`: in order to specify a string for relating data returned from a colony picker
`criteria`: a hash containing specific options related to picking colonies, for example `{"color": "white", ...}`.  Accepted criteria would be determined by the vendor and/or hardware involved in colony picking.

#### **Example**

```
{
  "dataref": string
  "op": "autopick",
  "from": well,
  "to": [well],
  "min_colony_count": int     // optional, default: 1
  "criteria": { ... }         // optional, default: {}
}
```

#### **Execution**
Accepted criteria for colony picking are determined by the vendor/hardware involved in this operation.

#### **Compatibility**
This ASC only specifies new fields of an existing instruction.
