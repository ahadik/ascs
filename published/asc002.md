#### **Title**
Sanger Sequencing

#### **Authorship**

#### **Motivation**
The Sanger sequencing reaction is usually performed by a dedicated sequencing device (or mail-out service), and as such warrants a dedicated Autoprotocol instruction.


#### **Proposal**
```
{
  "op": "sanger_sequence",
  "object": container,
  "wells": [well_index],
  "dataref": string
}
```

#### **Execution**
The container specified will be sent to the sequencing device or service and subsequently destroyed. The specified wells will be sequenced through the Sanger chemistry.

The specified wells should already contain the appropriate mix for sequencing, including primers and DNA according to the instructions provided by the vendor.


#### **Compatibility**
This ASC only specifies new instructions.
