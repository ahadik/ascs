#### **Motivation**

Allow for emptying a container by spinning it with the container opening facing outward.


#### **Proposal**

We introduce the properties `flow_direction` and `spin_direction` to the `Spin` instruction to allow spinning a container with the opening facing outwards so that well contents can be emptied simultaneously. 

Proposed new optional parameters:


`flow_direction` - specifies the direction that contents will tend towards with respect to the container. If unspecified `flow_direction` defaults to `inward`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`inward` - contents are spun into the container

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`outward` - contents are spun out of a container


`spin_direction` - a list of `cw`, `ccw`. Each element in the `spin_direction` list, the container will be spun in the stated direction for the set `acceleration` and `duration`. 

For clockwise(`cw`) and counterclockwise(`ccw`), the origin is defined at the top left corner of a container (for a plate that would correspond to well A1) (see inset figure). Axes follow the right hand rule with z-axis pointing out of a well. Movements in the positive direction along any of the axes are clockwise.

If `spin_direction` is unspecified and `flow_direction` is specified, `spin_direction` defaults to:
    "outward": ["cw","ccw"]
    "inward": ["cw"]


If both `spin_direction` and `flow_direction` are unspecified, `spin_direction` defaults to the original vendor specified `spin_direction`


```
{
  "op": "spin",
  "object": <container>,
  "acceleration": acceleration,
  "duration": time,
  "flow_direction": "inward" | "outward"  // optional, default: "inward"
  "spin_direction": [directions]  // optional, "cw" or "ccw",
                         "outward" default:["cw","ccw"],
                         "inward" default:["cw"]
}
```

`spin_direction` and `flow_direction` are vendor specific parameters that may not be available. Please check your vendorâ€™s documentation for availability. The `spin_direction` and `flow_direction` parameters are optional. 
The default for the `spin` instruction `flow_direction` will be `inward` - meaning the well openings will face towards the centrifuge center, causing the liquid to be pushed towards the bottom of the wells using the centrifugal force.
The default `spin_direction` for `inward` spin is set to `cw` or the vendor specified default.



#### **Compatibility**

This ASC appends new optional parameters with defaults to recapitulate existing behavior to an existing instruction and as such is fully backwards compatible.
