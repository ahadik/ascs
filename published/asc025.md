#### **Proposal**


```
{
  "op": "image_plate",
  "mode": "bottom" | "top" | "dark" | "fluorescence",
  "n": integer number of photos to take
  "object": container
}
```


Potential additional parameters:
* exposure time
   * can this be controlled with the IDS camera we're using?
   * what about for a scanner?
* number of images
   * should we average these, or provide all N images?
   * the workcell vibrates, so sometimes sequential images can be slightly out of alignment. Stav brought this up and mentioned that they might be taking out their averaging code and just using one image.
* focus depth?
* aperture?
* excitation wavelength for fluorescence images?


#### **Compatibility**
This ASC only specifies new instructions.
