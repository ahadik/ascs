#### **Motivation**
An instruction is required to specify sequence(s) of oligos to be synthesized, in-house or otherwise.

#### **Proposal**
The `oligosynthesize` Autoprotocol instruction specifies a list of oligonucleotides to synthesize, the final destination of the synthesized oligo, and the scale and purification method of synthesis. Vendors determine what constitutes a valid sequence based on their method of synthesis. Typically, at least the IUPAC codes for basepairs are accepted: http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/iupac.html

Example:

```
{
  "op": "oligosynthesize",
  "oligos": [
    {
      "destination": "my_plate/A1",
      "sequence": "CATGGGTAVNNNNGAAB",
      "scale": "25nm" | "100nm" | "250nm" | "1um",
      "purification": "standard" | "page" | "hplc",
        // default: standard
    },
    // â€¦
  ]
}
```

#### **Compatibility**
This ASC only specifies a new instruction.
