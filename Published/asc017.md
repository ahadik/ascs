#### **Title**

Add `measure_mass`, `measure_concentration` and `measure_volume` instructions

#### **Motivation**

To confirm or determine the properties of a sample, such as weight or volume a set of `measure` instructions can be used where the operation type determines the type of analysis for example `measure_mass`. `measure_mass` and `measure_volume` do not consume the sample. All concentration measurements (`measure_concentration`) such as for `measurement` `DNA` consume a vendor specific minimum amount of the sample - `volume` is indicating the amount of sample that will be used for the quantification. The accuracy of all results is vendor specific.


#### **Proposal**

```
{
    "op": "measure_mass",
    "object": ["container"],
    "dataref": string
},
{
    "op": "measure_concentration",
    "object": ["aliquot"],
    "volume": volume,   // default: "2:microliter"
    "dataref": string,
    "measurement": DNA | ssDNA | RNA | protein
},
{
    "op": "measure_volume",
    "object": ["aliquot"],
    "dataref": string
}
```


#### **Execution**

The dataref for `measure_concentration` contains a `concentration` in the form of `X ng/ÂµL` in addition to a `260/280 ratio` of type float.
The dataref for `measure_mass` contains a `mass` in the form of `X g`.
The dataref for `measure_volume` contains a `volume` in the form of `X uL`.


#### **Compatibility**

This ASC only specifies new instructions.
