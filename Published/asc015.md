#### **Motivation**
Separation of liquid samples using magnetic particles is a common laboratory practice involving the binding of samples to magnetic particles, followed by cycles of immobilization and washing of those particles, and finally elution of samples from the particles. The "Magnetic Bead Transfer" instruction specifies a method for processing magnetic particles that transfers the particles from solution to solution.

#### **Proposal**
This instruction allows the implementation of bead purification protocols by providing control over magnetic pins, protection tips which cover all of the pins, and the heating platform of a magnetic particle processing instrument. 

Five sub-operations have been defined to specify magnetic_transfer.

`collect` - used to collect beads from an `object`. Protection tips are magnetized and raised and lowered repeatedly pausing at the `bottom_position` for `pause_duration` time. The lowering, pausing, and raising is performed a number of `cycles` times. During this instruction, the `object` can be optionally heated to `temperature`.

`mix` - used to oscillate the tips vertically in an `object`. The oscillation will last for `duration` and move with a `frequency` and `amplitude` around `center`. During this instruction, the `object` can be optionally heated to `temperature` and the tips can be `magnetize`d.

`release` - used to release beads into an `object`. Non-magnetized tips are oscillated vertically. The oscillation will last for `duration` and move with a `frequency` and `amplitude` around `center`. During this instruction, the `object` can be optionally heated to `temperature`.

`dry` - used to dry beads with tips above and outside an `object` for a set `duration`.

`incubate` - used to incubate an `object` for a set `duration` with the tips moved to `tip_position`. During this instruction, the `object` can be optionally heated to `temperature` and the tips can be `magnetize`d.

The `magnetic_transfer` instruction takes a list of list of dicts. Each dict is a sub-operation. Each list of dicts represents a collection of sub-operations which will be performed in order using the same tip. The list of groups represents the collection of sub-operations, performed in order, with tip changes between each group.

The `bottom_position`, `tip_position`, `center`, and `amplitude` parameters are expressed as floats of relative well height. Setting one of these parameters to 0 represents positioning from the well bottom or height of 0, 1 represents positioning at the well top or the height of a well, and 2 represents positioning at twice the well height from the well bottom (or one well height above the well top) or twice the height of a well.

If `temperature` is null or unset, no heat will be applied and the container will not be set onto the heating plate.

Some vendor specific restrictions may apply to the number of containers supported per instruction, the compatibility of containers for the instruction, as well as the ranges supported for parameters in the each sub-operation.
